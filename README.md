## Feed Reader Testing Project for Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree at Udacity

In this project I was given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds from four popular blogs on Web Development and outputs them in the main window. There is also a menu which slides right and left when menu icon is clicked and lets the user choose one of four feeds.

My task was to implement a series of test sets using JavaScript Testing Framework [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) to check the application logic, event handling and DOM manipulation. I added my tests to `jasmine/spec/feedreader.js`.

## Running the Project

1. Download compressed project folder or clone the repo git clone `https://github.com/tragetraje/fend-feedreader.git`
2. Navigate to `index.html` on your local machine and open it in a web browser
3. Head to the end of the page to see the results of running the Jasmine tests
4. Navigate to `jasmine/spec/feedreader.js` to see the test suites I've written

## Technologies used

* JavaScript Testing Framework [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/)
* jQuery
